# React

React is a way to represent the user interface of an application and to alter that as data changes.

React for the application requires React Core and ReactDOM libraries.

The npm install command installs a package and any packages that it depends on.

```

$ npm install

```
The npm start command runs the app in development mode.

```

$ npm start

```
