# TLS

Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypts data sent over the Internet to ensure that eavesdroppers.

TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end security of data sent between applications over the Internet.

# HTTPS

Simply use HTTP over TLS precisely as you would use HTTP over TCP.

HTTP/TLS is differentiated from HTTP URIs by using the 'https' protocol identifier in place of the 'http' protocol identifier.

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.

Golang ResponseWriter interface is used by an HTTP handler to construct an HTTP response.
