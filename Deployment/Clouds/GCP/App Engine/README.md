# App Engine

To deploy applications on Google App Engine (GAE) using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you'll need to set up a GCP project, enable the necessary APIs, configure your application, and deploy the application.

Here's a step-by-step guide

1. Set up a GCP project

Create a Project: 

If you don't have one, create a new GCP project in the Google Cloud Console.

Enable APIs: 

Enable the necessary APIs for App Engine (App Engine Admin API) and Cloud Build.

Enable Billing: 

Ensure you have a valid billing account linked to your project.

2. Install the Google Cloud SDK

Install the gcloud CLI: Install the Google Cloud CLI (command-line interface) on your local machine.

Configure the gcloud CLI: 

Configure the CLI to connect to your GCP project.

3. Configure your App Engine application

Create an app.yaml file:

This file specifies the runtime environment and configurations for example your Python, Go or Node.js applications. 

For example: runtime: python39, runtime: go123 or runtime: nodejs16. 

Organize your app:

Structure your application files according to your chosen runtime and App Engine's requirements.

Consider static assets:

If your app includes static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images), place them in a directory like www/.

4. Deploy your application

Use the gcloud app deploy command: 

Deploy your application using the gcloud app deploy command.

Navigate to your project's root directory: Run the deployment command from the directory containing your app.yaml file.

Confirm Deployment: The command will prompt you for confirmation before deploying.

5. Update your application (Optional)

Use gcloud app deploy again: 

To update your app, simply run the gcloud app deploy command again from your project's root directory.

Example to configure app.yaml for Python 3.9

```

runtime: python39

entrypoint: gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py main:app

```

To define the runtime environment and settings for your Go application in an app.yaml file for Google App Engine deployment, you need to create this file and configure its elements.

1. Create the app.yaml file

In the root directory of your Go service, create a file named app.yaml.

This file is a configuration file that specifies your service's runtime environment settings, and your service will not deploy without it.

2. Specify the runtime

In the app.yaml file, you must specify the runtime element.

For a simple Go application in the standard environment, the minimal configuration is to specify the desired Go runtime version using the runtime element.

For example, to use Go 1.23, you would include:

```

runtime: go123

```
You can specify other supported Go versions. 

For specific versions and their corresponding Ubuntu versions, refer to the Runtime support schedule. 

3. Configure other settings (optional)

The app.yaml file can specify other settings, such as network settings, scaling settings, environment variables, and more.

App Engine provides default values for many settings, including instance class (memory and CPU) and automatic scaling. If you need to override these defaults, you can specify them in your app.yaml.

For example, to configure automatic scaling, you might include:

```

automatic_scaling:
  min_instances: 1
  max_instances: 10
  
```

To specify network settings, you can add network and subnetwork names to your app.yaml. 

4. Deploy your application

Once your app.yaml file is configured, you can deploy your Go application to App Engine.

Navigate to your application directory in the terminal and execute the deployment command:

```

$ gcloud app deploy

```

Monitor the deployment progress in the terminal for logs and to identify any potential issues.

By following these steps, you can define the runtime environment and settings for your Go application in the app.yaml file, enabling you to successfully deploy it to Google App Engine.

Key Considerations:

Choose the right runtime:

Select the appropriate runtime based on your application's language and framework.

Configure app.yaml:

Learn about the various configurations you can set in app.yaml, such as instance class, memory allocation, and traffic routing.

Use Cloud Build for automated deployments:

For more complex applications or CI/CD pipelines, integrate with Cloud Build.

Monitor and debug:

Utilize Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring to track your application's performance and troubleshoot issues.

Consider App Engine flexible environment:

For more control over your environment, use the App Engine flexible environment.
