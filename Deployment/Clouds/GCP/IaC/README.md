# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

To define Infrastructure as Code (IaC) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and deploy code, you can use tools like Terraform by HashiCorp, Deployment Manager, or even Cloud Build triggers.

Infrastructure Manager (Infra Manager) automates the deployment and management of Google Cloud infrastructure resources using Terraform.

## Defining Infrastructure as Code

Choose a Tool 

Select a tool like Terraform or Deployment Manager to define your GCP infrastructure using configuration files.

Configuration Files 

Write configuration files (e.g., Terraform files) that describe the desired state of your infrastructure on GCP. 

These files define resources, their properties, and dependencies. 

Source Control 

Store your configuration files in a version control system like Git.


## Deploying Code using IaC

Automated Deployment

Use tools like Cloud Build to trigger deployments based on changes in your IaC configuration files.

Terraform with Cloud Build

You can set up Cloud Build triggers to automatically apply Terraform configurations when changes are made to your repository.

Deployment Manager

You can use Deployment Manager to manage deployments of infrastructure templates, which can be used to provision and update your infrastructure. 

Change Management

Implement a change management process that ensures that all IaC changes are reviewed and approved before being deployed. 

Example utilizing Terraform with Cloud Build

1. Set up Terraform

Create a Terraform configuration directory with your main.tf, variables.tf, etc. files.

2. Create a Cloud Build Trigger

Configure a Cloud Build trigger to automatically deploy your Terraform configuration when a new commit is pushed to your repository.

3. Configure Cloud Build

Specify the Terraform commands to execute within the Cloud Build pipeline.

4. Backend

Set up a backend for your Terraform state file (e.g., a Cloud Storage bucket).

5. Test and deploy

Test your IaC configuration locally and then trigger the Cloud Build pipeline to deploy the changes to your GCP environment. 

Key Considerations:

State Management:

Use a remote state storage (e.g., Cloud Storage) to manage Terraform state files, allowing for consistent deployments. 

Security:

Ensure that your IaC configurations and deployment processes are secure, following best practices for access control and secret management. 

Change Management:

Implement a robust change management process that includes review and approval of IaC changes before deployment. 

Validation:

Validate your IaC configurations against your organization's policies and security standards.
