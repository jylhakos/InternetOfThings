# Google Cloud CLI

To deploy an application to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud CLI), you'll follow these steps.

1. Set up your environment

Install the gcloud CLI: 

Ensure you have the gcloud CLI installed on your machine.

Authenticate: 

Sign in to your Google Cloud account using gcloud auth login.

Configure your project: 

Specify the Google Cloud project you want to use with gcloud config set project <your_project_id>.

2. Choose your deployment target

Cloud Run: 

For building and deploying portable applications that can run anywhere.

Cloud Functions: 

For building serverless functions.

App Engine: 

For deploying web applications.

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): 

For deploying containerized applications.

3. Deploy your application:

Cloud Run: 

Use gcloud run deploy <service-name> --source . --region <your_region> (where . refers to the source code directory).

Cloud Functions: 

Use gcloud functions deploy <function-name> --runtime <runtime> --trigger-http --entry-point <function-entry-point> --source .. 

App Engine: 

Use gcloud app deploy app.yaml.

GKE: 

You'll typically use tools like kubectl to deploy to your GKE cluster. 

4. Configure your application

Cloud Run: 

You can configure authentication, environment variables, and other settings through the gcloud CLI and the Cloud Run UI.

Cloud Functions: 

You can configure trigger types, memory, and other settings through the gcloud CLI and the Cloud Functions UI. 

App Engine: 

You can define application settings in app.yaml. 

GKE: 

You can configure your application using Kubernetes manifests. 

5. Monitor and manage your deployment:

Use gcloud run describe <service-name> to view Cloud Run service details. 

Use gcloud functions describe <function-name> to view Cloud Functions details. 

Use gcloud app describe <app-id> to view App Engine application details. 

Use kubectl describe <resource-type> <resource-name> to view GKE resources. 

An example deploying a Cloud Run service from source code:

1. Navigate to your source code directory:

```

   $ cd /path/to/your/app
   
```

2. Deploy the service:

```

   $ gcloud run deploy my-service --source . --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated

```

Description

my-service: The name of your Cloud Run service.

--source .: Indicates that the application source code is in the current directory. 

--region us-central1: Specifies the region to deploy the service in (e.g., us-central1). 

--allow-unauthenticated: Allows unauthenticated requests to the service (optional).
