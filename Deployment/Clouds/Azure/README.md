# Azure

## Managing and deploying applications on Microsoft Azure.

To manage and deploy applications on Microsoft Azure, utilize Azure App Service for web app hosting, Azure DevOps for CI/CD, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) for resource management.

### Azure App Service

Deployment:

App Service offers various deployment methods, including zip files, web deploy, GitHub integration, and Docker containers.

Continuous Deployment:

You can configure continuous deployment to automatically deploy your application when changes are pushed to your code repository. 

### Azure DevOps

CI/CD:

Azure DevOps is a powerful tool for building and deploying your application using CI/CD pipelines.

Release Pipelines:

You can create multistage release pipelines to automate deployments to different environments (e.g., test, staging, production). 

### Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

Deployment:

ARM is the core deployment and management service for Azure resources.

Templates:

You can use ARM templates to define the infrastructure and configuration of your application.

Management:

ARM provides tools for managing resources, including access control, locks, and tags.

Scalability:

ARM supports various scaling strategies, allowing you to scale your application up or down as needed. 

### Azure Functions, Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Container Apps

Azure Functions: 

For event-driven, serverless applications, consider using Azure Functions.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): 

If you need more control over your container deployments, use AKS.

Azure Container Apps: 

A managed container deployment service for simplified container deployments.
