# Amazon Web Services (AWS)

What are the services in AWS?

Some of the key services categories in AWS include:

Compute: 
 
 EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, and Lightsail that provide scalable computing capacity and serverless options to run applications.  
 
Storage: 
 
 S3, EFS, and Glacier that offer object, file and archive storage with high durability and availability.  
 
Databases: 
 
 RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, Neptune, and Timestream for relational, NoSQL, in-memory, and time series data.  
 
Networking: 
 
 VPC, Direct Connect, and Route 53 that provide networking capabilities and connectivity options for resources.  
 
Analytics: 

 EMR, Athena, Kinesis, and QuickSight that enable big data analytics and insights from data.  
 
Security: 
 
 IAM, GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie that provide identity management, threat detection, security assessments, and data security.  
 
Management Tools: 
 
CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config, OpsWorks, and Service Catalog that enable governance, auditing, automation and management of AWS resources.

## Managing and deploying applications in the AWS cloud environment.

Deploying and managing applications on AWS can be accomplished through various services such as Elastic Beanstalk, CodeDeploy, and App Runner. 

Elastic Beanstalk provides a managed platform for deploying and managing Go applications, while CodeDeploy offers automated deployments, and App Runner is a container-based service for deploying applications without managing infrastructure.

1. Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk automates the process of deploying and managing applications, allowing you to focus on your code rather than infrastructure.

Prerequisites: Create an AWS account and set up your Go development environment.

Deployment: You can deploy Go applications to Elastic Beanstalk using the EB CLI or the AWS Management Console.

Management: Elastic Beanstalk provides tools to manage your application, including monitoring, logging, and scaling.

2. Using AWS CodeDeploy:

Deployment: CodeDeploy automates deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, and other AWS services.

Management: CodeDeploy offers features like blue/green deployments, canary deployments, and rollback capabilities.

Integration: CodeDeploy can be integrated with CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions.

3. Using AWS App Runner:

Deployment: App Runner simplifies deployment by handling infrastructure management for containerized applications.

Management: App Runner provides features like automatic scaling, monitoring, and integration with other AWS services.

Go Runtime: App Runner supports Go applications, and you can configure build and run commands.

4. Additional considerations:

AWS SDK for Go:

To deploy an application using the AWS SDK, you need to configure your SDK with credentials and region, establish a session or client for AWS services, and then use the SDK's API calls to interact with AWS resources.

You can deploy your application using different AWS services like EC2, CodeDeploy, Lambda, or Elastic Beanstalk.

Utilize the AWS SDK for Go to interact with AWS services from within your Go applications.

Docker:

Packaging your Go application in a Docker container can simplify deployment and management on AWS.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

IaC tools allow you to automate the deployment process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.

Tools like CloudFormation and AWS CDK can be used to provision and manage your AWS infrastructure.

### Learn to deploy and manage AWS applications using Infrastructure as Code tools like CloudFormation.

To deploy and manage applications on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), you can leverage AWS CloudFormation and AWS CDK. 

CloudFormation enables you to define and manage AWS infrastructure using declarative JSON or YAML templates, while CDK provides a framework for describing infrastructure using familiar programming languages.

1. Using AWS CloudFormation:

Define Infrastructure:

Write a CloudFormation template that describes the AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets, databases) needed for your application.

Deploy Infrastructure:

Upload the template to CloudFormation and initiate the deployment process.

CloudFormation will create and configure the resources as specified in the template.

Manage Changes:

Modify the template and re-deploy to update or add resources. CloudFormation automatically manages the changes, ensuring the desired infrastructure state.

2. Using AWS CDK:

Install and Initialize:

Install the CDK and create a new project.

Define Resources:

Write code (e.g., Go, Python or TypeScript) to define the AWS resources required by your application.

Synthesize Template:

Run the cdk synth command to generate a CloudFormation template from your CDK code.

Deploy Infrastructure:

Run the cdk deploy command to deploy the generated template and provision the infrastructure.

Manage Changes:

Edit the code, synthesize a new template, and redeploy to make changes to the infrastructure. 

### Example: Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk

1. Create a Go application: Write your Go application and package it for deployment.

2. Install the EB CLI: Install the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface.

3. Configure the EB CLI: Configure the EB CLI with your AWS credentials.

4. Deploy your application: Use the eb deploy command to deploy your application to an Elastic Beanstalk environment.
