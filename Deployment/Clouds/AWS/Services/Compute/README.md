# Compute

## Lambda

Lambda is serverless, event-driven compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. 

You can execute code in response to events like S3 uploads or API Gateway requests. 

You write functions, upload them to Lambda, and they are executed in response to events like HTTP requests, file uploads, or other triggers. 

AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance.

Key Features and Benefits

Serverless: 

You don't need to provision or manage servers. 

Event-Driven: 

Functions are triggered by events, making them ideal for handling dynamic workloads. 

Pay-as-you-go: 

You only pay for the compute time your functions use.

Automatic Scaling: 

Lambda scales up or down automatically based on demand.
